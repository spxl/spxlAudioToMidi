# spxlAudioToMidispxlAudioToMidi is a small tool made with [Processing](http://www.processing.org/ "Processing language and development environemnt") used to generated a set of MIDI control signals from an incoming audio sourcebased on a frequency analysis ([FFT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFT "Fast Fourier Transform")). "Meters" are shown on the left, "monitors" on the right. Meters start with lowest frequency rangesat the top and highest frequency range at the bottom. Monitors produce MIDI "CC" messages starting with CC01 at the top and CC10 at the bottom.This frequency range order for the monitors may seem silly, but keeps everything in natural top-to-bottom reading and counting order.The tool depends upon two external libraries:* [Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/ "Minim audio library for Processing") (for the FFT analysis, included with Processing)* [proMIDI](http://creativecomputing.cc/p5libs/promidi/ "proMIDI library for Processing by Christian Riekoff") (for sending out the MIDI information).You will need to install the proMIDI library in the `libraries` subfolder of your *Sketchbook* folder, or otherwiseas later described by documentation for Processing.The mouse and keyboard controls are a little esoteric. Basically left-click the mouse (and drag) to do something,right-click the mouse to reset something.Find a full(er) description at the [spxlAudioToMidi page on subpixels.com](http://subpixels.com/processing/spxlAudioToMidi/)in case I don't get around to finishing here.### Mouse ControlsLeft-clicking (and optionally dragging) the upper portion of a "monitor" (box on the right side) sets the maximumoutput value; clicking the lower portion of a monitor sets the minimum output value. Maximum and minimum can bereversed so that a the output is inverted relative to the input.Right click a monitor to reset default full range (not inverted).Left-click near the left edge of a monitor (you will see a circle and a "Drag to meter" notice appear to let youknow you are in the target area), drag a connection to whichever meter (boxes on the left side) you wantand release. Right-click in that target area to the left of a monitor to reset the link to the default meter.### Keyboard ControlsKeyboard controls can be found in the spxlAudioToMidiXX.pde file, if not in the top comments, then in the `keyPressed()` method.The most 'exciting' controls are `R` (upper-case R) to randomise the output ranges of all the monitors, `S` to reset,and `Q` to randomise which meter all the monitors are connected to, `A` to reset.	[1/2/3/../9/0] set output MIDI channel	[!/@/#/../(/)] set output MIDI device	[p/space] toggle pause	[m] toggle mute on/off	[l] reset meter levels	[E] toggle easing on/off	[e] reset easing value (and turn easing on)	[up] increase snappiness of easing	[down] decrease snappiness of easing	[q/Q] randomise link for monitor/s	[a/A] reset link to default for monitor/s	[f/F] flip min, max for monitor/s	[v/V] invert range for monitor/s	[r/R] random range for monitor/s	[s/S] reset range for monitor/s	[F1] toggle meters display	[F2] toggle monitors display	[h] toggle hex/decimal value display_____## Links* [Processing]: http://www.processing.org			"Processing language and development environemnt"* [FFT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFT			"Fast Fourier Transform"* [Minim]: http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/		"Minim audio library for Processing"* [proMidi]: http://creativecomputing.cc/p5libs/promidi/	"proMIDI library for Processing by Christian Riekoff"
